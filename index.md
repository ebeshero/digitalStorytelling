# Digital Storytelling
## a course to be taken in about four weeks

This course is adapted with thanks from [Lori Jakiela's course material](https://upgstories.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/welcome-to-digital-storytelling-1-syllabus-and-course-details/), and is offered to fulfill a core requirement in the [Digital Studies Certificate program](http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies) at the [University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg](http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/).

The key idea here is to learn narrative techniques that apply digital tools, working with blogs, photo essays, podcasts, sound compositions, short video clips that combine together with words to produce narratives shared mindfully with audiences in a digital environment. We'll concentrate on learning how by reviewing successful blogs and sites incorporating multimedia in a manner that shares moving stories. We'll work with great care on how images and sound are not merely illustrations but necessary to the delivery of meaningful and moving content.

I'm importing this image from Prof. Jakiela's syllabus, because it helps to convey how an image can convey character, emotion, and be integral to a concept. You may create your own digital compositions in this course or "remix" others into your own, providing some reference and a link outward when you do so.
